# What is this?

This repo shows how to use Django and Elasticsearch together and how to perform searches via Elasticsearch with normal ORM. DRF was used for the example.
<br><br>
<b>Custom development</b><br>
Normally, pagination on DRF does not support elasticsearch documents. A special pagination class has been created for this. For details of this, you can look at the "drf_custom_pagination_for_elastic" repo.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Elasticsearch
3. Install Postgresql
4. Install requirements.txt
5. Fill .env file
